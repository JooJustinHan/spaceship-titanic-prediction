# spaceship-titanic-prediction
An ongoing Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition submission

Visualize yourself setting off on a trip through the universe on the Spaceship Titanic, a spacecraft offering excitement and exploration in the immense realm of outer space. This trip, influenced by stories of discovery and the pursuit of understanding, shifts dramatically when a spacetime anomaly unexpectedly transports certain passengers to an unknown dimension, prompting contemplation on destiny, probability, and the factors influencing such occurrences.

Our investigation of this occurrence is conducted not via space travel or telescopes, but rather by analyzing data. By analyzing the Spaceship Titanic's records, which are included in an extensive dataset, we aim to identify patterns and predictors that may shed light on the circumstances surrounding the unexpected disappearance of certain passengers. This study uses machine learning to go through passenger data, looking at anything from cabin allocations to other personal details, in an attempt to determine the elements that may have affected their chances of being transported to the unknown.

Navigating the complexity of this task will require us to utilize a range of models and analytical tools to develop a good predictive model that can support in determining which passengers were and were not transported to an alternate dimension. We understand that our audience may not be as familiar with these statistical and technical methods as we are. Therefore, we are dedicated to interpreting our approach and findings into the most understandable and relatable language. 

Join us as we use data science tools to analyze this event, with the goal of extracting practical insights that, although based on a hypothetical situation, showcase the potential of using comparable methods to address real-world issues in similar matters.
